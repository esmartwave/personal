* Stretches
* Yoga
* Martial Art activities

### Day - Stamina and Strength

* Med-High cardio (running/biking is a good baseline)
* Strength training
* Usually less time available to do these, except on weekends
* Getting results requires this take longer
* Martial arts activities
* HIIT might be good here

### Night - Release & Relax

* Light cardio
* Body relaxing/scanning
* Stretches
* Yoga is great
* 8 minute quiet time
