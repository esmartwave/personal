### Mornings

I want to use this time as a "warm-up" for the day. The older we get, the more stretching and activation we need.
* Low cardio
* Muscle Activation
* Stretches
* Yoga
* Martial Art activities

### Afternoons or Whenever

* Med-High cardio (running/biking is a good baseline)
* Strength training
* Usually less time available to do these, except on weekends
* Getting results requires this take longer
* Martial arts activities
* HIIT might be good here


### Evenings
* Low cardio
* Body relaxing
* Stretches
* Yoga
* 8 minute quiet time
