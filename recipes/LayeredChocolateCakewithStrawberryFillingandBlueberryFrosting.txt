Instructions:
[Chocolate Cake]

[Strawberry Filling]
	Coat the surface of the cakes (top and bottom) that will touch the filling with a thin layer of frosting. This will prevent the filling from seeping into the cake. Hull the strawberries. Puree half of the strawberries in a food processor with the honey, maple syrup, lemon juice, and vanilla until it is a smooth sauce. Add the remaining strawberries and pulse until chopped, but not liquefied. Create a "dam" of frosting on the bottom cake, to prevent the filling from squishing out.

[Blueberry Frosting]
	Gently melt the butter, and mix it with the milk and vanilla. squish out all the juice from the blueberries using a sieve or colander. Blend in the sugar and blueberry juice. If you want to add the blueberries for purple color/texture, go ahead.

[Accent Frosting]
	melt butter, and beat until light and fluffy. Beat in sugar, continuing again until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and lemon juice, beat until smooth.

Notes: "Hulling" means cutting off the tops with a paring knife.

I pre-made the icing and filling and stored in a ziploc. Same can be done with cellophane and a tupperware container.

I also ran out of sugar, and did the following to the cake:
1 cup sugar
1 cup agave nectar
2 cups milk

To make it into an elephant:
I baked two 9x13 in. cakes and then stacked them on top of each other. Then I cut the whole cake in half and placed them next to each other like a "T" shape. The horizontal became the head and vertical became the body.

Next, I rounded the elephant's head and body free hand with a serrated knife. Extra pieces were used for the trunk and legs. After the shape was finished, I iced it with a light blue frosting, drew the eyes, and added details. The ears were made of white chocolate dyed with blue food coloring to match the icing. It held up pretty well.
