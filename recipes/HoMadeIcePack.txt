Ingredients:
	2 cups water
	1 cup rubbing alcohol or high-proof vodka (I used Everclear)
	Food coloring for the blue tint (optional)
	2 zip-top bags â€“ quart or gallon-size or vacuum sealer bags

Instructions:
	Mix the water and alcohol together in one of your zip-top bags and add food coloring, if desired, until you get that perfect blue tint.
	Release as much air as possible and seal the bag. I recommend double bagging for strength. (If you have a vacuum sealer use a vacuum seal bag for the outer layer to further prevent accidents.)
