Title: Slow Cooker Pumpkin Bread Pudding
Description: Put this bread pudding together the night before* and when you wake up your house will smell like pumpkin pie. This is meant to be a breakfast recipe and so isn’t very sweet. If you would like it sweeter, increase the brown sugar to 1 and ¼ cups. I like to serve this bread pudding for breakfast with a drizzle of whole milk or cream. For dessert, a scoop of vanilla ice cream is lovely.

Ingredients:
	6 eggs
	1 and 1/2 cups milk
	7.5 ounces canned puréed pumpkin (that’s 1/2 of a 15 ounce can)
	3/4 cup brown sugar

	2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
	1 tsp. vanilla
	1/4 tsp. salt
	1 Tbsp. butter

	1 (16 oz.) loaf of sliced cinnamon bread

Instructions:
	In a medium bowl lightly beat the eggs with a whisk and then add the milk, pumpkin, brown sugar, pumpkin pie seasoning, vanilla and salt. Whisk until just combined.
	Rub the butter along the bottom and all around the sides of a 3 quart slow cooker like this one I’ve linked to here. Spoon 1 cup of the egg batter into the slow cooker. Lay 3 slices of bread in a single layer onto the batter in the slowcooker, overlapping the bread slightly so that they fit. Add 1/2 cup more batter and then 3 more slices of bread. Continue until you have used up all the bread. Pour remaining batter over the top.
	Turn the slow cooker to low, cover it and let it cook for 7-8 hours. Remove lid and, leaving the slow cooker on, for 20 minutes to evaporate some of the moisture.
