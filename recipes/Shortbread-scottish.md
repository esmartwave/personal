Ingredients:
- 1 cup salted butter, softened (use unsalted if you wish but add salt back in)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp confectioner sugar to sprinkle on top (or I prefer apricot jam)

Instructions:
1. Heat oven to 375º F (190 ºC)
2. Start by mixing the butter and sugar together, but DO NOT CREAM them (see notes). The butter shouldn't be too soft, but also not straight from the fridge, especially if you use a mixer.
3. Add the flour and mix to a stiff consistency. Don't overwork the dough; stop when it just comes together. That's it, you've just made shortbread dough: I told you it was easy!
4. Roll out into the shape of a pan or tin you want to bake them in. I baked this in an 8 x 8 pan. Trim the edges to the approximate size. 
    - **FINGERS**: Place it in the pan of your choice. One mistake many people make is rolling the shortbread too thin. Proper shortbread should be quite thick (no less than 3/4" or 2cm if making fingers). Tip: make sure your fingers are wide enough that a fork can prick them. Use a bench scraper or knife to cut the dough into fingers. Next, prick the shortbread with a fork, about half way through. 
    - **ROUND**: You can also shape the dough into a ball, roll it out into a round, and score into triangles, then prick with a fork.  
    - **MOULD**: (brush the mold with a little oil, and sugar first to ensure it comes out nicely). Roll out the dough, place over the mould and roll again to press into it. Remove the excess dough then turn out onto a tray. If your shortbread mould doesn't have a pretty design, prick it with a fork
    - **CUT OUT SHAPES**: roll out more thinly (as with sugar cookies) and cut with cookie cutter. Place onto prepared baking sheet and prick evenly.
5. Place in preheated oven for 15 to 30 minutes (depending on which thickness or shape) or until slightly brown on edges. Sprinkle with sugar immediately upon removing from the oven. Shortbread shouldn't be darkly colored. Let your shortbread cool on or in the pan or tray before moving to rack to cool completely.
6. Serve warm with maple syrup, honey, or fruit.

Notes:
- Quality ingredients are KEY, especially the butter.
- The butter and sugar should be thoroughly amalgamated, but not creamed (as when making a cake and the result becomes light and fluffy-shortbread dough takes only a few minutes to make.)
- USE A SCALE FOR BEST RESULTS.
- If for some reason your mixture doesn't come together, press it into a pan or use to make a crumble topping - there is no reason to throw it away.
- Store in a sealed container (an old Walker's tin is excellent) and keep in a cool, dry place. Shortbread will keep well for weeks, but is also excellent after being frozen.
- If you plan to keep your shortbread for more than two weeks, I'd suggest freezing it.
