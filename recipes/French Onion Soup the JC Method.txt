Julia Child French Onion Soup

-- probably should add worchestire, or something to give it a little extra something, and use stronger cheese than standard swiss.

Ingredients

 2       tablespoons butter
1/4     cup olive oil
3       lbs onions, halved and sliced thin
2       cloves garlic, minced very fine
1       teaspoon granulated sugar
2       cups dry white wine
6       cups beef stock or chicken stock (the beef will make a darker, more robust soup)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 ovenproof soup bowls
12      toasted slices of French baguettes, 1/2 inch thick
2       cups Swiss cheese, grated
3       teaspoons Parmesan cheese, grated

Directions

In a large saucepan over medium heat melt the butter and oil together.
Add the onions, garlic, and sugar.  Saute until slightly colored, stirring occasionally (don't stir too much - you want them to brown), for 7 minutes.
Add the white wine, raise temperature to medium high, and bring to a boil.
Lower temperature back down to medium and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the stock, raise temperature to medium high and bring to a simmer.
Lower temperature to low and simmer *uncovered* for 1 1/2 hours (90 minutes).
At this point you can freeze the soup for reheating later (after thawing).
To serve at this point, continue with steps:  first, preheat your broiler.
Ladle the soup into the ovenproof soup bowls (6 of them).
Place two slices of toasted baguette onto the top of each soup bowl.
Sprinkle each serving with 1/3 cup of Swiss cheese, then 1/2 teaspoon of Parmesan cheese.
Place soup bowls onto a baking sheet and place in oven under preheated broiler.
Broil until the cheese melts (watch them carefully - depending on your broiler and how far the rack is from the heat, it can take anywhere to 45 to 90 seconds or so).
Serve immediately.
