Categories: quinoa, breakfast
Ingredients:
	1 cup organic 1% low fat milk
	1 cup water
	1 cup organic quinoa, (hs note: rinse quinoa)
	2 cups fresh blackberries, organic preferred
	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	1/3 cup chopped pecans, toasted*
	4 teaspoons organic agave nectar, such as Madhava brand

Instructions:
	Combine milk, water and quinoa in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 15 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed. Turn off heat; let stand covered 5 minutes. Stir in blackberries and cinnamon; transfer to four bowls and top with pecans. Drizzle 1 teaspoon agave nectar over each serving.
	*While the quinoa cooks, roast the pecans in a 350F degree toaster oven for 5 to 6 minutes or in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 3 minutes.

Notes: I used a red quinoa here, but you can use whatever kind you like, white/buff colored seems to be the most common. Also, a few notes and tips from the book: low-fat soy milk may replace the low fat milk, blueberries may replace the blackberries, dark honey may replace the agave nectar, and walnuts may replace the pecans.
