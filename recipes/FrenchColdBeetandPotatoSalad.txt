Ingredients:
[Vinagrette]
	1 tbsp red/white wine vinegar
	1/8 tsp salt
	1/4 tsp dry mustard
	6 tbsp olive oil
	1 tbsp minced herbs of choice

[Salad]
	2 cups diced, peeled potatoes
	2 cups diced cooked beets or canned beets
	4 tbsp minced shallots or green onions
	1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
	3 tbsp fresh minced green herb of choice (I used tarragon)
	1 cup of one or a combination of the following: green peas, cooked and diced green beans, broccoli, carrots, asparagus, diced raw apples, diced cooked meat of choice.

Instructions:
	Boil 2 cups of diced, peeled potatoes until fork pierces easily, about 20 minutes. Let them cool just slightly, They need to be warm for tossing. Toss with the vinaigrette, beets, and shallot in a large bowl. I used 1 can (14.5 oz) of already diced beets that were drained first. I've never cooked beets from scratch and I am sure they would taste much better fresh, but I didn't really plan to do this recipe until the last minute. Add salt & pepper if desired, cover bowl and refrigerate for 24 hours.
	Mix the herbs with the mayonnaise, and gently fold into the other ingredients. Stirring it in will mash the potatoes. Choose one of the options, and fold into the salad I used a combination of steamed french-style cut green beans and grated raw carrot.
