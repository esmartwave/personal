Ingredients:
	2 lb fresh white fish filet- I recommend corvina, chilean sea bass or halibut
	Lime juice from 15-20 limes
	4 garlic cloves, gently crushed to keep them whole
	2 to 3 hot peppers, sliced in half lengthwise
	10 sprigs of cilantro
	1/2 bunch of cilantro, finely chopped
	3 to 4 medium shallots, peeled and sliced thinly – use 2 paiteña onions if you are in Ecuador
	2 tbs light olive oil
	Salt to taste
	Sides – Tostado, chifles, patacones or popcorn

Instructions:
	Cut the fish into small squares, place into a non-reactive bowl (glass is best), cover with water and salt.
	Cover and let rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
	Rinse the fish, add the lime juice, crushed garlic, hot peppers and the cilantro sprigs. Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours.
	Remove the crushed garlic, hot peppers and cilantro springs.
	Soak the shallot slices in salted water, rinse well and drain.
	Add the sliced shallots, chopped cilantro, olive oil and salt to the fish and lime juice bowl. Let marinate for another 30 minutes in the fridge.
	Serve with tostado, popcorn, chifles or patacones.
