Ingredients:
[Accompany]
	Vanilla ice cream
	Honey crème fraiche

[Egg wash]
	1 egg, whisked
	~2-3 tablespoons of sugar to sprinkle on top

[Pumpkin Filling]
	1 small pumpkin, about 2 lbs – organic if possible, cut in half, seeds and membranes removed
	1 lb panela or piloncillo, broken into chunks
	5 cinnamon sticks
	5 cloves
	3 all spice peppers
	~ 3 cups water

	15 to 18 medium or 25-30 small sweet empanada discs – recipe here

Instructions:
[For the candied pumpkin]
	Cut the pumpkin into 1 inch slices.
	Place the chunks of panela or piloncillo, the water and the spices in large pot. Cook until the panela chunks have dissolved.
	Bring the panela or piloncillo syrup to a boil over medium heat, add the pumpkin slices and boil for about 30 minutes. Try to avoid stirring while the pumpkin is cooking.
	Reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 hour or until the syrup thickens.
	Let the candied pumpkin slices cool down until safe to handle.
	Remove the skins from the pumpkins and reserve the candied pumpkin pulp for the empanadas.

[Pumpkin empanada assembly]
	Place a spoonful of the candied pumpkin mix on the center of each empanada disc.
	Fold the empanada discs and press the edges together using your fingers. You can either use a fork to press down on the edges and seal the empanadas; or you can use your finger to twist the edges and form a curl like seal.
	Refrigerate the empanadas until ready to bake.
	Pre-heat the oven to 375F.
	Lightly brush the top of the empanadas with the egg wash.
	Sprinkle the sugar on the top of the empanadas.
	Bake the empanadas in a pre-heated oven at 375 F for approximately 20 minutes or until golden on top.
	Serve either warm or cold with ice cream or honey crème fraiche. You can also use any of the leftover panela syrup to drizzle on top.
