Yield: 4 to 6 servings
Active: 20 min
Total: 1 hr 35 min
Ingredients:
	2 tablespoons unsalted butter
	1 onion, sliced
	3 stalks celery, diced
	2 carrots, peeled and diced
	Salt and white pepper
	1/2 teaspoon turmeric
	8 cups chicken stock (or combination water and stock)
	2 cups dried yellow split peas
	2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
	1 ham hock (optional)
	Dark bread croutons, for garnish
	Brown mustard

Instructions:
	Melt butter over medium-low heat in a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Cook onion, celery and carrots with salt and pepper until onion is soft, about 7 to 10 minutes. Add the turmeric, stock, peas, potatoes, and ham hock, and simmer, covered, about 1 hour. Remove the ham hock. Puree soup in a blender or food processor until smooth. Return to clean pot, and adjust the seasonings. Serve immediately in flat soup dishes with wide (3-inch) rims, garnished with dark bread croutons. Place brown mustard on the rims of the bowls, and take a little mustard with each spoonful of soup.

Notes: I also added 3/4 cup of almonds too, but peanuts would work the same of thickness. I also put NO potatoes and almost twice the number of peas. Oh, and I added a 1/2 or so cup of leek.
