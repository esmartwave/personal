Ingredients:
	2 cups (241g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
	1/4 cup (25g) whole flax meal
	1/4 cup (35g) whole flax seeds, optional
	1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, room temperature
	1/2 cup (106g) light brown sugar
	2 large eggs
	2 teaspoons vanilla extract
	3/4 cup (170g) buttermilk or plain yogurt, or 2/3 cup (152g) liquid whey
	1 1/2 cups (213g) blueberries, fresh or frozen
	coarse sparkling sugar, to sprinkle on top, optional

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease a muffin tin; or line it with papers, and grease the papers.
	Whisk together the flour, flax meal and seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
	In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar until creamy.
	Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
	Add the vanilla and buttermilk and mix again. The batter may look a bit curdled; that's OK.
	Add the dry ingredients, mixing on low speed just until the batter is smooth. Fold in the berries by hand.
	Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups, using a heaping 1/4 cup for each; a muffin scoop works well here. Sprinkle each muffin with a bit of coarse white sparkling sugar, if desired.
	Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center of one comes out clean. Remove them from the oven, cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer the muffins to a rack to finish cooling.
	Yield: 12 muffins.
