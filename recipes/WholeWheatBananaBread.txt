Categories: bread, banana
Ingredients:
	1/3 cup melted coconut oil or vegetable oil (can use butter if that's what you have)
	1/2 cup honey
	2 eggs
	1 cup mashed bananas (4-5 bananas)
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, plus more to swirl on top
	1 3/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1/4 cup hot banana juice

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius) and grease a 9Ã—5 inch loaf pan.
	In a large bowl, beat oil and honey together. Add eggs and beat well.
	Put peeled bananas into a large bowl, cover in cling film and microwave for 5 minutes (this will release banana juice).
	Strain the bananas, separating the juice using a metal strainer.
	Stir in bananas and vanilla, then stir in the salt and cinnamon. Lastly, stir in the flour, just until combined.
	Add baking soda to hot banana juice, stir to mix, and then mix briefly into batter until it is evenly distributed. Spread batter into the greased loaf pan.
	Sprinkle with cinnamon and swirl with a toothpick or the tip of a butter knife for a pretty marbled effect.
	Bake for 60 to 65 minutes. Be sure to check that the bread is done baking by inserting a toothpick in the top. It should come out clean. Let the bread cool in the loaf pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes before slicing.

I love baking bread in my Le Creuset stoneware loaf pan so much that it deserves a mention. The loaf pan is non-toxic, heats evenly and cleans easily. Highly recommended!
