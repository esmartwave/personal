Title: Corn Grits
Description: A Southern breakfast and dinner staple served primarily with eggs, ham, and braised meats, grits are a great dish to have in your back pocket. Grits are coarsely ground white or yellow corn that is simmered in liquid to make a soft, porridge-like side. They go beautifully with this shrimp and tasso recipe, courtesy of Maxieâ€™s Supper Club in Ithaca, New York.

Ingredients:
	1 1/2 cups water
	3/4 cup whole milk, plus more as needed
	1/4 cup heavy cream
	3 tablespoons unsalted butter
	1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed
	1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper, plus more as needed
	3/4 cup yellow or white corn grits (not instant)

Instructions:
	Combine the water, milk, cream, butter, salt, and white pepper in a medium saucepan with a tightfitting lid over medium heat and bring to a simmer.
	Stir in the grits and bring to a simmer again. Cook, without stirring, until the grits float to the surface, about 1 to 2 minutes. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit until all of the moisture has been absorbed, at least 10 minutes. Whisk until smooth, taste, and add more salt and white pepper as needed. Whisk in additional milk as needed to reach the desired consistency.

Notes: Could also add bacon fat and eliminate the butter, or remove the butter and cream and increase the amount of whole milk.
