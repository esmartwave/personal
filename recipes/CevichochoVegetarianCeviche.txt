Ingredients:
	4 cups of chochos or lupini beans, about 20 oz
	1 red onion, thinly sliced
	2 to 3 tomatoes, thinly sliced
	Juice of 2 oranges
	Juice of 8-10 small limes
	1 small bunch of cilantro, finely chopped
	2 tbs of light olive oil (you can use regular olive oil, but I find that it overpowers the ceviche)
	1/4 â€“ 1/2 cup of tomato sauce or ketchup, adjust according to your preference
	Salt to taste

Instructions:
	Place the sliced red onions in a large bowl, sprinkle with salt (about 1 tbs) and cover with warm water. Let them soak for about 10 minutes, then drain the water and rinse well with cold water. This will help remove the bitterness from the onions.
	Combine the washed red onions, tomato slices, chochos, tomato sauce or ketchup, chopped cilantro, lime juice, orange juice, olive oil and salt (not a lot is needed as the chochos are already salty).
	Let the chocho ceviche marinate for a couple of hours in the refrigerator before serving.
	Serve cold with maiz tostado, green plantain chips, avocado and hot sauce.
