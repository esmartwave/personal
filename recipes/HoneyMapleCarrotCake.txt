	Pour batter into the pans. Bake 45-55 minutes or until toothpick test succeeds.

	Spread a little buttercreme on the serving plate, then place a layer on the plate. Cover first layer thickly with buttercreme.
	Add second layer, cover it completely with buttercreme.
	Finish off the remaining buttercreme by adding a second coat for good measure. :)
	While frosting is still soft, assort the nuts around the cake, pressing them into the frosting.
	Chill the cake. Serve at room temp, probably leave it out 30-45 minutes before serving!
