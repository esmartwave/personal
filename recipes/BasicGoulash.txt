Ingredients:
	• Extra-virgin olive oil
	• 250g onions, sliced
	• 2 garlic cloves, crushed
	• 1 green pepper, deseeded and diced
	• 500g beef shin, cut into small cubes
	• 1 tbsp paprika
	• 11/2 litres beef stock
	• 11/2 tbsp chopped marjoram
	• 1/2 tbsp caraway seeds
	• Red wine vinegar
	• 2 tomatoes, finely chopped
	• 1 tbsp tomato purée
	• 200g potatoes, peeled and diced
	• Sour cream (optional), to serve

Instructions:
	Add a good splash of oil to a large pan and gently sauté the onions, garlic and pepper until softened. Add the beef and continue to cook until the meat is browned and the vegetables are cooked. Stir in the paprika and cook for 2 more minutes, then add 200ml of the beef stock. Bring to the boil and cook until reduced by half. Add the marjoram, caraway seeds, a splash of vinegar, the tomatoes, the tomato purée and season well.
	Add enough stock to cover and simmer until the meat and vegetables are tender, about 11/2–2 hours. Add the potatoes, plus any remaining stock and a little water if it’s looking too dry, and simmer until the potatoes are cooked. Serve with a dollop of sour cream, if you like.
