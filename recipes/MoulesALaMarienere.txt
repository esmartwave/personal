Ingredients:
	1/4 cup all-purpose flour
	3 quarts (about 3 pounds) mussels, scrubbed and debearded
	1 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio
	1/4 cup minced scallions, shallots, or leeks
	4 parsley sprigs, plus 1/4 cup roughly chopped parsley for garnish
	1/2 of a bay leaf
	1/2 tsp roughly chopped fresh thyme
	1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper
	3 tablespoons unsalted butter
	1 baguette, in 1/2-inch slices, drizzled with olive oil and toasted

Instructions:
	Whisk together the flour and 4 cups of water in a large mixing bowl. Add the cleaned mussels to the flour-water mixture, topping off with water as needed to cover the mussels. Allow the mussels at least half an hour of soaking time in order to ensure that they disgorge any sand and grit.
	Bring the wine, minced onion, parsley sprigs, bay leaf, thyme, pepper, and butter to a simmer in a large (6+ quarts) stockpot over high heat.
	Meanwhile, drain the mussels from their flour and water liquid, and rinse once more.
	Add the clean mussels to the stockpot, top with the lid and shake vigorously from time to time, in order to ensure that the mussels cook evenly. Continue with this for 5 minutes, or until the majority of the mussel shells have opened (this is your indication that they're cooked through).
	Serve the mussels in shallow soup/pasta bowls, and ladle over some of their briny broth on top. Garnish with minced parsley, and serve alongside the toasted baguette.
