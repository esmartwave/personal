	3 -to 4-pound boneless pork roast with a good marbling of fat, or two large tenderloins for the grill
	4 teaspoons kosher salt
	1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
	1 teaspoon dried thyme or sage leaves
	1 bay leaf, crushed
	1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
	2 cloves garlic, minced or put through a press

Instructions:
	Dry the meat well with paper towels. In a bowl or a mortar, mix the remaining ingredients together and rub into the surface of the pork. Place in a covered dish and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 2 days. Turn the meat 2 or 3 times if the marinade is a short one; several times a day if longer.
	Heat oven to 325 degrees, or a grill to medium-high. Scrape off the marinade and dry the meat thoroughly with paper towels.
	For roasting, place meat on a rack in a shallow pan and turn often until just cooked through, about 30 minutes per pound or until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees.
	For grilling, place tenderloins on oiled grate, cover, and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, turning every 2 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees. Cover meat with foil and let rest 10 minutes before slicing.
