Title: Borax Ant Killer
Description: When ants show up in your home, often your first reaction may be to grab the phone and call the exterminator.  (Or, perhaps that is your second reaction, as your first reaction may be to want to squish them all.)  Before calling the exterminator, save yourself money and chemicals in your home by trying a simple, three ingredient solution for getting rid of ants in your home.

Ingredients:
	1/2 cup of sugar
	1 1/2 tablespoons Borax (find Borax on Amazon with free shipping here!)
	1 1/2 cups warm water
	Cotton balls or paper towel

Instructions:
	Mix the Borax and sugar together until well combined.
	Add the mixture to your warm water and mix constantly until the powder has been completely dissolved.
	Seal the mixture in a jar or container for future use, and use only what you need in the next steps (and save the rest). It is important that you clearly label the jar, as it will just look like water. Do not leave this where children can get to it. (Because this is such an easy solution to make, however, I only kept what I made until after the ants had been gone for a week or more.)
	Fill some jar lids, milk caps, or other shallow containers with cotton balls or a wad of paper towel.
	Add the sugar-Borax solution to the prepared lids making sure to soak the cotton balls (or paper towel).
	Wait. It may take the ants a while to find the solution. But, once they do, let them feast (and take the solution back to their home). At our house, to speed up the finding process, I placed a couple of the soaked cotton balls directly on the ledge in my kitchen where most of the ants were.
