Ingredients:
[For the cake]
	1/2 cup (115 g) butter
	1 cup (250 g) sugar
	2 eggs
	1 + 1/2 cup (375 g) flour
	2 + 1/2 cc (12 g) baking powder ( or yeast)
	3/4 cup (190 ml) milk
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	1 pinch of salt

[For the topping (syrup)]
	1 + 1/2 cup (375 ml) water
	1/2 cup (125 mL) maple syrup (no fakes please)
	2 cups (500 g) brown sugar
	1 tbsp (15-20 g) flour

Instructions:
[Prepare the cake]
	Cream butter, gradually add sugar + eggs and beat well for a few minutes.
	In another bowl, combine flour (fine rain ...) + baking powder + salt
	Mix the first preparation alternating with the trio flour + baking powder + salt and milk.
	Flavor with vanilla. Mix well.
	Pour into a buttered rectangular mold (or if like me into individual molds).

[Prepare the topping]
	Combine all ingredients and heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar melts.
	Remove the syrup in the bottom of the buttered baking dish and cover with the dough "to Janette."
	Bake at 375 ° F ( approx. 180 ° C), about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the inside is cooked ... as usual.
