Yield: 12 pancakes

Total Time: 25 minutes
Cuisine: American
Category: Breakfast

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (or 2) tbsp granulated sugar
- 3 tbsp molasses
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 tsp ginger (powdered)
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted (or cocounet oil)
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 large egg (add another if feeling eggstra eggy, or sometimes I through in egg white powder)

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger and salt.
2. Mix the milk and molasses and vanilla together into well combined; mix, don't whisk heavily.
3. Make a well in the center and add milk mixture, melted butter, vanilla, and egg.
4. Whisk until mostly smooth; batter will be thick (some lumps are fine). Add a bit more milk if needed.
5. Heat a buttered nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.
6. Pour about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake; spread lightly into rounds.
7. When bubbles appear and edges set, flip and cook until golden on both sides.
8. Serve warm with maple syrup, honey, or fruit.

Notes:
- Do not overmix; overmixing reduces fluffiness.
- Cook pancakes immediately after mixing; sitting batter loses lift.
- To freeze: cool completely, wrap stacks in plastic and foil, freeze up to 3 months. Reheat in toaster or microwave.
- Measure flour by spooning into the cup and leveling off to avoid dense batter.
