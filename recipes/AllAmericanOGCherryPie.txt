Title: All-American OG Cherry Pie
Description: Tart cherries, which are sometimes called pie cherries or sour cherries, are seldom sold fresh. This ruby-red fruit is frozen or canned shortly after harvesting to seal in the fresh flavor. Consumers can find unsweetened tart cherries, either canned or frozen, in most supermarkets.

This Midwest classic always gets rave reviews. Serve it plain or topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
