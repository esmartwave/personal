Ingredients:
	2 pounds fresh unshelled chestnuts
	2 to 3 sprigs rosemary
	1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
	2 teaspoons (or more) kosher salt
	of freshly grated nutmeg
	Freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 375°.
	Place a large sheet of foil on a rimmed baking sheet. Place chestnuts, flat side down, on a work surface. Using a utility knife or a sharp paring knife, carefully cut through the shell on the rounded side of each chestnut to score an X.
	(Blanch) Soak in a bowl of hot water for 1 minute (this helps them steam while roasting).
	Drain chestnuts and pat dry; place in a medium bowl. Add rosemary, butter, 2 teaspoons salt, and nutmeg. Season with pepper and toss to thoroughly coat. Arrange chestnuts in a single layer in center of foil (a few might overlap) and gather up edges of foil around chestnuts, leaving a large opening on top.
	Roast until the peel begins to curl up and chestnuts are cooked through, 30-45 minutes, depending on size and age of nuts.
	Transfer chestnuts to a platter, using a spatula to scrape in any butter and spices with them, and toss to coat. Season with more salt, if desired. Serve hot or warm.
