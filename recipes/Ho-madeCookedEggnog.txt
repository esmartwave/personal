Ingredients:
	12 farm-fresh eggs (separated if you’ll whip whites later) - If you get pastuerized eggs you don't need to cook
	1 lb granulated sugar (about 2 cups)
	2 pint whole milk (add 1-2 pints to thin the mix)
	1 qt heavy cream
	3/4 lb sugar
	1 tsp salt
	1 tsp vanilla extract
	1 tsp cardamom
	½ tsp cinnamon
	Dash of nutmeg to garnish
	Optional booze options - Old Grand Dad (whiskey), Myers Rum, Brandy

Equipment: 
	3- to 4-quart heavy saucepan
	Digital thermometer (instant-read or clip-on)
	Whisk
	Large bowl and ice bath
	Fine mesh strainer

Instructions:

1. Separate eggs

	If whipping whites later, separate yolks and whites carefully.
	Store whites in a clean bowl in the refrigerator.

2. Combine yolks, sugar, and salt

	In the saucepan (off heat), whisk yolks, sugar, and salt until thick and pale.

3. Warm the dairy

	In a separate pot, gently warm milk + cream over medium-low heat until 110–120 °F—warm to the touch, not hot.

4. Temper the eggs

	Slowly drizzle about 1 cup of warm milk into the yolk mixture while whisking constantly.
	This raises the temperature gradually and prevents curdling.

5. Pasteurize

	Pour the tempered mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the milk/cream.
	Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, scraping the bottom and sides.
	Watch the thermometer: when it reaches 160 °F, immediately remove from heat.
	Hold for 15 seconds if possible, but do not exceed 165 °F.

6. Rapidly cool

	Immediately pour the hot base into a bowl set in an ice bath.
	Stir for a few minutes to bring the temperature down below 70 °F, then refrigerate until cold (≤ 40 °F).

7. Add vanilla

	Stir in vanilla once cooled.

8. Chill and Serve

	Chill at least 4 hours for flavor melding. Serve plain or with nutmeg/cinnamon.

☁️ Optional: Whipped Egg Whites

If you want a lighter, frothier texture:

	Pasteurize the whites separately using one of these methods:
	Buy pasteurized shell eggs (safe to whip without heating), or
	Warm whites gently in a double boiler, whisking constantly until 160 °F, then immediately cool on ice.
	Once cooled, whip to soft peaks and fold gently into the chilled eggnog just before serving.

🧊 Serving: 

If desired, you can add spirits after cooling—alcohol does not pasteurize the mixture.
