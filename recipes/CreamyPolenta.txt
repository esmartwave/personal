Ingredients:
[optional]
	12 ounces Cabot Sharp Cheddar or Cabot Extra Sharp Cheddar, grated (about 3 cups)*

	7 cups hot water
	2 cups polenta (not "quick-cooking") or coarse-ground yellow cornmeal
	2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
	2 teaspoons salt

Instructions:
	Combine water, polenta, olive oil and salt in slow cooker; whisk until well blended. Add cheese and whisk again.
	Cover and cook on high setting for 2 hours, or until liquid is mostly absorbed. Stir together well (polenta should have consistency of thick cooked cereal).
	(If not serving right away, pour onto oiled baking sheet with sides, spreading into even layer; cover with plastic wrap and let cool. When ready to serve, cut into rectangles and saut√© in nonstick skillet with olive oil until golden on both sides.)
