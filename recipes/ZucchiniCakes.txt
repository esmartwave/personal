Ingredients:
	2 1/2 cups shredded zucchini
	1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
	1 egg, lightly beaten
	2 tablespoons chopped onion
	1 tablespoon butter, melted
	1 teaspoon prepared mustard
	3/4 teaspoon seafood seasoning
	1/2 cup crushed butter-flavored crackers
	2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Instructions:
	In a bowl, combine the zucchini, bread crumbs, egg, onion, butter, mustard and seafood seasoning; mix well. Shape into five patties. Dip in cracker crumbs. Heat oil in a large skillet; fry patties for 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

Notes: I subbed butter for veganaise, seafood seasoning for equal parts turmeric/paprika, added garlic, nixed the crackers and used coconut oil. Not too heavy, crabcake consistency and still delish. 

Make sure to garnish with diced tomatos and pinches of salt. I also whipped up a garlic/oregano/paprika/veganaise spread.
