Ingredients:
	5 large Russet potatoes, about 3 lbs, peeled and cut in chunks (can use yucca root)
	2 tbs sunflower or avocado oil
	1/2 cup finely chopped white onion
	2 tsp ground achiote
	1 cup grated quesillo or mozzarella cheese
	Salt to taste

[To serve]
	Salsa de mani or peanut sauce
	Tomato and onion curtido
	Avocado slices and lettuce leaves
	Fried eggs
	Grilled or fried chorizo or sausages
	Hot sauce or aji criollo

Instructions:
	Boil the potatoes until soft.
	Heat the oil over medium high heat to make a refrito, add the onions and achiote, cook until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.
	Mash the potatoes, mix in the onion refrito and salt to taste.
	Cover the potato dough and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour.
	Make small golf size balls with the potato dough.
	Make a hole in the middle of each ball and fill with the grated or crumbled cheese.
	Shape the dough into thick patties and let rest in the refrigerator for about 1/2 to 1 hour.
	Cook the patties on a hot griddle until browned on each side, be careful when turning them as they will be very delicate.
	Serve with a fried egg, peanut sauce, tomato and onion curtido, avocado slices and hot sauce.
