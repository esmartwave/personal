Ingredients:
	1 3 lb. pork shoulder roast
	1 onion chopped
	1 head of garlic peeled and roughly chopped
	2 carrots peeled and chopped
	1 bay leaf
	1 sprig of rosemary
	1/4 oz. sage
	2 cups of low-sodium broth (home-made pork broth is best made with the trimmings and the bones from the cleaning of the pork being used)
	2 cups of strong coffee (espresso preferred)
	1/2 cup of sambuca
	1 cup of creamy ricotta
	1/2 cup of parmesan
	sea salt to taste and fresh cracked pepper
	6 pasta sheets (or enough to use all filling prepared)
	1 egg and 2 Tbsp. milk for egg wash on pasta

Instructions:
	Place pork in a large pan. Add all ingredients except cheeses, salt and pepper. Cover. Bring to a boil then lower heat to medium and simmer for 1 hour. Remove the lid and start skimming the foam that builds on the liquid. Simmer uncovered for another 90 minutes or until well cooked. Remove from heat. Let pork shoulder rest in the liquid and cool. Remove pork from the liquid. Remove excess fat from the roast and shred the meat. Strain the vegetables (do not discard, this is your wonderful pork flavor) from the juice and return juice back to the fire (you can use same pan) over medium heat and reduce to a glaze (about 20-25 minutes). Set aside. Chop the vegetables (previously removed from the pan) and fold together with your shredded meat and cheeses. Season with sea salt and fresh pepper to taste. Fill your fresh agnolotti pasta sheets with 6 oz. of the meat mixture per agnolotti. Seal all agnolotti with egg wash of 1 egg and 2 Tbsp. milk. Serve with a fennel cream sauce and drizzle the pork juice glaze over the dish to add extra flavor and embellishment.
