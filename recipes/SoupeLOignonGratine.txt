Ingredients:
	5 cups thinly sliced yellow onions
	3 tablespoons butter
	1 tablespoon oil
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon sugar
	3 tablespoons flour
	2 quarts beef stock, boiling
	1/2 cup dry white wine (Chardonnay or white Bordeaux)
	salt and pepper to taste
	3 tablespoons cognac (peorre ferrand preferred)
	4 to 6 rounds of hard-toasted French baguette (or stale baguette)
	1 1/2 cups grated soft amish Swiss
	1/2 cup ementhaler Swiss for topping before baking

Instructions:
	Cook the onions slowly in the butter and oil in a covered saucepan for 15 minutes. Uncover, raise heat to medium and stir in the salt and sugar. The sugar will help the onions to brown. Cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions have turned a deep golden brown.
	Sprinkle in the flour and stir over heat for 3 minutes.
	Off heat, blend in the stock. Add the wine and season to taste. Simmer partially covered for another 30-40 minutes or more, skimming if needed. Correct seasonings.
	Just before serving, stir in the cognac. Place rounds of bread in soup bowls or a tureen and pour soup on top. Sprinkle with grated cheese and brown under a hot broiler until golden and bubbly. Serve immediately.

Notes: The key to French Onion soup is the slow cooking of the onions in butter and oil, followed by a long, slow simmering in stock. This helps them to develop the rich flavor this soup is known for.
