Ingredients:
	220 g all-purpose flour (GF is fine)
	1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
	1/4 tsp ground cloves
	1/4 tsp ground white pepper
	1 tsp ground Grains of Paradise
	1/2 tsp ground cardamom
	1/2 tsp ground ginger
	1/2 tsp vanilla powder or extract
	1 tsp baking soda
	95 g sugar
	125 g butter, soft
	1 egg
	pinch of salt

Instructions:
	Sift the flour and mix it with the spices and sugar.
	Add the egg and the soft butter. Use your hands or a stand mixer to mix/knead the dough until it has a uniform consistency.
	Divide the dough into four pieces and roll them to four long bars.
	Use a knife to cut the bars into small walnut sized pieces. Roll each piece into a small Peppernut cookie.
	Put the Peppernuts on an oven tray lined with parchment paper and bake them at 200 C (400 F) for about 8-10 minutes or until they are nice and golden. The baking total time depends on the size of your Peppernuts. Make sure your oven is fully heated up before starting to bake the cookies. It is better to wait 5-10 minutes extra for the oven to fully heat up.
	Let the Peppernuts cool off and store them in an airtight box or jar.
