Categories: whole wheat, pizza
Ingredients:
	pinch of sugar
	1 cup warm water
	1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
	1 cup whole wheat flour
	1.5 tsp (or 1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
	1/4 tsp salt
	1/2 to 1 tbsp olive oil
	cornmeal for sprinkling (optional)
	1 tbsp each garlic powder, italian seasoning, onion powder or whatever spices you want (to taste)

Instructions:
[DOUGH]
	Mix a little sugar into the warm water.
	Sprinkle yeast on top. Wait for 10 minutes or until it gets all foamy.
	Pour into a large bowl.
	Add flour, salt, olive oil. Combine.
	Knead for 6-8 minutes until you have a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (add a bit more flour if you need to).
	Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes.

[Pizza]
	Lightly grease two 12-inch pizza pans.
	Sprinkle with a little bit of cornmeal.
	Divide dough in half.
	Place each half on a pizza pan and pat it with your fingers until it stretches over the whole pan.
	Try to make it thicker around the edge.
	If desired, pre-bake at 425 F for 10 minutes (I don't always do this).
	Then spread with pizza sauce and use the toppings of your choice.
	Bake at 425 F for 10-20 minutes longer or until bubbly and hot.
	Makes 2 12-inch pizzas.
	If you don't want to use all the dough, you can freeze it.
	Take a portion of dough, form into a ball, rub olive oil over it and place it in a freezer bag (the oil makes it easier to take out of the bag).
	When you want to make a pizza, take dough out of freezer and allow to thaw before using.
