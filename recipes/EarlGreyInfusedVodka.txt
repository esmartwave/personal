Ingredients:
	1 750ml bottle mid-shelf vodka
	4 Tbsp earl grey (give or take)
	1 airtight container

Instructions:
	Pour the vodka into the container
	Add the tea bags
	Seal the container and let sit for anywhere from 6 -24 hours. How long you do this really depends on how much you want the vodka to taste like tea. Don’t go longer than a day though because the vodka will start to take on a bitter quality and since the whole idea was to make the stuff taste better failing to do so kind of defeats the purpose.
	Taste occasionally. I mean you have to, right? You wouldn’t want something to go wrong.
	Remove the tea bags.
	Transfer the vodka back to the original bottle or a decanter if you’re fancy. There shouldn’t be any sediment but if there is, strain the liquid through a coffee filter.
