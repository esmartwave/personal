Ingredients:
	1 (3-pound) boneless pork shoulder roast (Boston butt)
	1 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon dried rubbed sage
	1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
	1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
	Cooking spray
	1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
	4 cups whole milk
	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
	4 fresh sage leaves
	2 bay leaves
	1 thyme sprig
	1 (10 x 3/4-inch) strip lemon rind
	8 cups hot cooked brown rice

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 325°.
	Unroll the pork; trim and discard fat. Reroll the pork; secure at 2-inch intervals with twine. Combine salt, dried sage, dried thyme, and pepper; rub salt mixture over pork.
	Heat a Dutch oven coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add pork, and cook 7 minutes, browning on all sides. Remove pork from pan. Add garlic to pan, and sauté 30 seconds. Add milk and the next 5 ingredients (milk through lemon rind); bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Return pork to pan. Cover and bake at 325° for 45 minutes. Uncover. Turn pork; bake, uncovered, at 325° for 45 minutes. Turn pork; bake an additional 30 minutes or until pork is fork-tender. Remove from pan; cover and keep warm.
	Place pan on stovetop over medium-high heat, and bring milk mixture to a boil. Cook until mixture is reduced to 2 cups (about 20 minutes), stirring frequently. Discard the lemon rind, sage leaves, bay leaves, thyme sprig, and twine. Cut pork into 1/2-inch slices; serve with sauce and rice.
