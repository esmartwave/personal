Ingredients:
	2 tablespoons canola oil
	1 medium onion, finely chopped
	2 garlic cloves, minced
	3 cups cooked white rice
	2 cups cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1 teaspoon ground coriander
	1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
	2 to 3 tablespoons vegetarian worcestershire sauce (regular can be used as well)
	salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	fresh cilantro (optional)
	sliced green onion (optional)

Instructions:
	Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
	Add onion and sauté until it just begins to soften and turns color.
	Add garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until onion is golden.
	Add spices and Worcestershire, and stir into onion and garlic.
	(The first time I made this, I was afraid to add the full 3 Tbsp of Worcestershire, but the addition of the rice balances the flavor out).
	Next, add the beans and then the rice.
	Combine the rice and beans evenly and cook until mixture is heated through.
	Add salt and pepper to taste and serve hot.
	Garnish with some chopped cilantro or green onions if you prefer.
	Vegetarians use only the vegetarian Worcestershire sauce.
