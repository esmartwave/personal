Ingredients:
[Dark Corn Syrup]
	2 Tbsp Honey
	1 Tbsp Brown Sugar
	1 Tbsp Molasses

	1/2 cup(s) (packed) brown sugar
	1/2 cup(s) maple syrup
	1/4 cup(s) dark corn syrup
	3 tablespoon(s) butter or margarine, melted
	1 tablespoon(s) dark Jamaican rum
	1 teaspoon(s) vanilla extract
	3 large eggs
	1 1/2 cup(s) pecans, coarsely chopped

Instructions:
	In large bowl, whisk brown sugar, syrups, butter, rum, vanilla, and eggs until blended. Stir in pecans. Pour filling into hot pie shell. Bake 35 minutes or until filling is puffed and set at edges but still jiggles slightly in center. Cover rim of pie with foil after 20 minutes to prevent over-browning. Cool completely on wire rack.

[Variation]
	For Chocolate Mixed-Nut Pie, prepare Maple-Pecan Filling as above, but melt 2 ounces chopped unsweetened chocolate with butter. Coarsely chop 3/4 cup pecans, 1/2 cup walnuts, and 1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, substituting them for all the pecans.
