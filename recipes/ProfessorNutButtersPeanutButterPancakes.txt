Title: Professor Nut Butter's Peanut Butter Pancakes
Description: These pancakes are delicious.  Fluffy and peanut buttery.  A little maple syrup on top and it is the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  If your kids are banana eaters they would be a wonderful addition.

Ingredients:
	1 1/4 cup flour
	2 Tablespoon granulated sugar
	1 Tablespoon baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1 1/4 cup milk, dairy or non-dairy
	1/4 cup peanut butter

Instructions:
	In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
	In small bowl or measuring cup, stir together the milk and peanut butter til smooth.  Add to the dry ingredients and beat just until a batter is formed.  Do not overbeat.
	Lightly oil a nonstick saute pan or griddle over medium heat.  Spoon the batter by 1/4 cupfuls inot the pan.  Cook until golden brown on both sides.  Serve immediately.

Notes: The batter to these pancakes is thicker than the usual, but the pancakes still manage to come out fluffy and light. I will often double this recipe as my boys love pancakes, but also to have a few left over for breakfast the next day.
