Ingredients:
	1 cup all-purpose flour
	1 tablespoon white sugar
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1 egg, beaten
	1 cup milk
	2 tablespoons vegetable oil
	2 ripe bananas, mashed

Instructions:
	Combine flour, white sugar, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil and bananas.
	Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.
	Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.

Notes: Sub Oil for equal parts applesauce or butter.

Also, I should add whipped cream and walnuts to this...
