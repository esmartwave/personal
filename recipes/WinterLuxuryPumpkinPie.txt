Ingredients:
	1/2 cup white sugar (down to 1/3)
	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
	1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
	1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
	Cardamom
	2 large eggs
	2 cups pumpkin mash
	1 cup half-and-half or heavy cream
	1 unbaked 9-inch deep-dish pie shell

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Throw all the spices and wet ingredients into the blender and blend until smooth and well-mixed. Pour into a chilled prepared pie shell and bake for around 45 to 50 minutes or until the pie's center is no longer jiggly and a toothpick can be inserted in the center and come out clean. Once the pie is cool, cut a slice and hit it with a mountain of fresh whipped cream.
