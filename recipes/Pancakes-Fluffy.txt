Yield: 12 pancakes
Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: 15 minutes
Total Time: 20 minutes
Cuisine: American
Category: Breakfast

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 tbsp granulated sugar
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 3/4 cups milk
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1 large egg

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, vanilla, and egg.
3. Whisk until mostly smooth; batter will be thick (some lumps are fine). Add a bit more milk if needed.
4. Heat a buttered nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.
5. Pour about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake; spread lightly into rounds.
6. When bubbles appear and edges set, flip and cook until golden on both sides.
7. Serve warm with maple syrup, honey, or fruit.

Notes:
- Do not overmix; overmixing reduces fluffiness.
- Cook pancakes immediately after mixing; sitting batter loses lift.
- To freeze: cool completely, wrap stacks in plastic and foil, freeze up to 3 months. Reheat in toaster or microwave.
- Measure flour by spooning into the cup and leveling off to avoid dense batter.
