Ingredients:
[Compote]
	several sprigs of thyme, tied with twine
	1 cup cherries, pitted
	2 cups figs, quartered
	1 cup Balsamic vinegar
	2 tbs honey
	1/2 cinnamon stick

[Stuffing]
	200 g olives, pitted and chopped
	Zest of 2 lemons + juice of 1
	1 head of garlic, chopped
	1/2 cup bread crumbs
	1/2 cup olive oil
	several sprigs of thyme, stripped

	4.5 lb Fraser Valley leg of lamb, butterflied
	Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper
	Olive oil
	1 bunch fresh basil leaves

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 400˚F (204˚C)
	Combine stuffing ingredients.
	Trim the lamb of excess fat and sinuous bits. Wash and pat dry. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper, then massage the meat with some olive oil.
	Spread the stuffing in one even layer. Layer on basil leaves. Roll and truss the lamb to create a roast. Adjust the diameter of the roast to ensure even cooking time. Place the lamb on a roasting pan, rub over once more with olive oil, and place into the hot oven.
	While the lamb is roasting, add the thyme, cinnamon stick and Balsamic vinegar into a medium sauce pan. Reduce the vinegar by 1/3 on medium heat. Add the cherries, figs, and honey. Simmer for 3 minutes, remove from heat, and set aside.
	A nice brown crust should form on the lamb after 15 minutes of cooking. When the desired colour is achieved, drape a piece of aluminum foil over the meat and continue to cook for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 135˚F (57˚C).
	Remove from the oven and allow the meat to rest under a foil tent for 15 minutes.
	Remove the thyme and cinnamon stick from the compote. Carve the lamb and serve with warm compote on the side.
