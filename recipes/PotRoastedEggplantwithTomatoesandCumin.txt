Ingredients:
	1 large eggplant (1 1/4 pounds)
	4 garlic cloves, minced
	Kosher salt
	1 cup drained, canned diced tomatoes
	3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
	3 tablespoons chopped parsley
	1 tablespoon cilantro leaves
	2 teaspoons sweet smoked paprika
	3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
	Pinch of cayenne pepper
	1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
	Freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
	Heat a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Using a fork, prick the eggplant in a few places. Add the eggplant to the casserole, cover and cook over moderately low heat, turning once, until charred on the outside and soft within, about 40 minutes.
	Transfer the eggplant to a colander set in the sink. Using a sharp knife, make a lengthwise slit in the eggplant; let drain for 10 minutes. Scrape the flesh into a bowl, discarding the skin and any hard seeds; mash to a puree and transfer to a large skillet.
	Using the side of a large knife, mash the garlic to a coarse paste with 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the paste to the skillet along with the tomatoes, olive oil, parsley, cilantro, paprika, cumin and cayenne. Cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
