Ingredients:
	2 T vegetable oil
	1 medium onion, diced
	1 small red sweet pepper, diced
	1 jalapeno, seeded and diced
	3 cloves garlic, minced
	1 1/4 cup long grain white rice, soaked 20 minutes and drained until dry
	1/8 tsp dried thyme
	1/4 tsp ground black pepper
	pinch chipotle pepper or cayenne pepper (optional)
	1/4 tsp dried oregano
	1/4 tsp turmeric
	1/2 – 3/4 tsp salt, or more to taste
	1 1/2 cup water
	1 can coconut milk
	15 oz. small red beans, drained

Instructions:
	In medium‐large heavy‐bottomed pot, heat oil over medium heat.
	Add onion and cook 5 minutes.
	Add peppers and cook 2 minutes.
	Add garlic and cook 1 minute.
	Add rice and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
	Add spices (thyme through salt) and stir.
	Add water and coconut milk and stir well.
	Bring to a boil and stir in beans and return to a boil.
	Lower heat to low and simmer for 20 – 25 minutes, covered.
	Stir every 5 minutes to avoid sticking and add more water if needed to prevent it from drying out.
	This is more like risotto than a fluffy rice.
	When rice is finished cooking, stir one more time, scraping the bottom if necessary, cover and let sit for 10 minutes.
	Serve hot.
