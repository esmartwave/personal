Ingredients:
	3 cups heavy cream
	3/4 cup sugar
	1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
	2 teaspoons fresh ginger, finely minced or use microplane grater
	2 teaspoons salt
	8 cups sweet potatoes (or yams), peeled, thinly sliced (2-1/2 pounds)

Instructions:
	Cook over high heat until reduced to about 2 cups of liquid, about 15 minutes. You will need to stir constantly otherwise it will burn. When done the mixture will be thick and somewhat custardy-like.
	Stir the sweet potatoes into the cream mixture, coating each and every slice with the cream. Okay, you don't have to get that crazy but you get the idea.
	Ladle sweet potato-cream mixture into six individual creme brulee dishes or one shallow 2-quart casserole dish.
	Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
