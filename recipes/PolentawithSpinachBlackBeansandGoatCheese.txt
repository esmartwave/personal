Ingredients:
	1 teaspoon olive oil
	2 garlic cloves, minced
	1/2 cup fat-free, less-sodium vegetable broth (such as Swanson Certified Organic)
	1/4 cup chopped drained oil-packed sun-dried tomato halves
	1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
	1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
	1 (6-ounce) package fresh baby spinach
	4 cups water
	1 cup uncooked polenta
	1 tablespoon butter
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	3/4 cup (3 ounces) crumbled goat cheese
	Cracked black pepper (optional)

Instructions:
	Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic to pan; saut√© 1 minute or until golden. Stir in broth, tomatoes, cumin, and beans; bring to a simmer. Cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Add spinach, tossing to combine.
	Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add polenta, butter, and salt; stir well with a whisk. Reduce heat, and simmer 3 minutes or until thick, stirring constantly.
