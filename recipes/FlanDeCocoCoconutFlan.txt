Ingredients:
[To garnish]
	Fresh berries and toasted coconut

[For the coconut flan]
	6 eggs
	1 14 ounce can of coconut milk
	1 12 ounce can of evaporated milk
	1 cup grated coconut
	3/4 cup sugar, adjust to taste
	1 tbs grated orange zest
	3 tbs corn starch
	Pinch of salt

[For the orange caramel]
	1 cup sugar
	1/4 cup of water
	1/4 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice

Instructions:
[Orange Caramel]
	Combine water, orange juice and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan over medium high heat to make caramel.
	Bring to a boil and cook until the caramel starts to turn a light brown honey color, be careful as it can burn very quickly. It takes about 7-9 minutes to get to the point where you start to see the caramelization start, don’t stir the caramel mix as it cooks, just let it boil until it starts to darken. Because this caramel sauce has orange, it won’t get as dark as the regular caramel.
	Quickly and carefully pour the caramel into ramekins or flan molds.

[For the coconut flan]
	Pre-heat oven to 350
	Using an electric mixer mix eggs, coconut milk, grated coconut, orange zest, sugar, evaporated milk, corn starch and pinch of salt together until all the ingredients are well blended
	Pour the flan mixture into the ramekins
	Place the ramekins in a baking pan with water, the water should fill up to about ½ of the height of the ramekins or molds,
	and bake for 40-50 minutes – or until the flan has set.
	Cool down and refrigerate the coconut flan for a couple of hours before serving.
	To remove from the molds, bring the flans to room temperature. Use a knife to help loosen the edges, and place it upside down on the serving plate. Garnish with berries and/or toasted coconut.
