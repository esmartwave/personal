Title: Avocado Carbonara
Description: That’s right – avocado! This stuff does wonders when you want to add creaminess to anything from smoothies to sauces. While it gives the dish a bit of  green color, it’s just as creamy as any soy-based cream.

I remember first seeing this genius pasta sauce on Oh She Glows a while back but not being able to find good avocados. (Sadly) it became another bookmarked buried deep in a folder of hundreds of other amazing recipes, all of which I’ve promised I’ll try! I spotted some great-looking avocados on sale the other day, picked up a few and immediately remembered this recipe. The moment I got back home, I whipped up this delicious lunch…

Ingredients:
	1 medium sized ripe Avocado, pitted
	Juice and zest of half a lemon
	2 to 3 garlic cloves, depending on your taste (I used 2 only)
	Pinch of salt (to taste)
	1/4 cup of fresh herbs (I used half basil and half parsley, I’d probably opt for all parsley next time)
	2 T extra virgin olive oil
	1/3 cup of walnuts, chopped and toasted
	Freshly ground pepper (to taste)
	Fresh parsley, to garnish
	Pasta, to serve (2-3 serves, around 80z?)

Instructions:
	Begin by cooking your pasta.
	Meanwhile, make the sauce by place lemon juice (not the zest), garlic and olive oil in a food processor. Process until fairly smooth.
	Add in the remaining ingredients except for those used to garnish/decorate (ie everything except walnuts, pepper, parsley for garnish, pasta and zest). Process until very smooth and creamy.
	Toss the pasta in the sauce.
	To serve, garnish with fresh parsley, pepper, lemon zest and walnuts.
