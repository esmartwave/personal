Ingredients:
	1 dozen eggs
	1 1/2 cups of bourbon
	1/2 cup of cognac
	1/3 cup of dark rum
	1 1/2 cups of sugar
	4 1/2 cups of whole milk (extra to thin if needed)
	1 1/2 cup of cream

Instructions:
	Separate yolks and place whites into clean airtight container.
	Mix yolks, sugar and add booze in airtight container.
	Freeze whites in airtight container.
	Store for up to three weeks.

[Before Serving]
	Thaw whites the night before.
	Whip whites to firm peaks, place in a separate bowl.
	Whip cream to soft peaks.
	Fold cream into egg whites.
	Fold together with everything else, garnish with cinnamon or nutmeg and serve.

[Alternative]
	We stirred together a dozen eggs, 1 1/2 cups of bourbon, 1/2 cup of cognac, and 1/3 cup of dark rum; added 1 1/2 cups of sugar; and refrigerated the 18-percent-alcohol mixture in an airtight container. After three weeks, we poured the base through a sieve to remove any egg solids and then mellowed out the mixture with 6 cups of whole milk and 1/2 cup of cream, bringing it down to about 8 percent alcohol. The unanimous verdict: Alongside a fresh batch, which tasted comparatively boozy and harsh, our aged nog went down more smoothly. To age your favorite eggnog recipe, be sure to use 1 1/2 ounces of 80 proof liquor for every egg, and leave out the dairy until serving.

Notes: Satisfied with the sterility of the drink, we set out to produce an equally safe (but less potent) nog. Our solution? Waiting until serving time to add the dairy. This way, we could use enough alcohol to properly sterilize the eggs during storage and then temper the booze-egg base with dairy for serving.
