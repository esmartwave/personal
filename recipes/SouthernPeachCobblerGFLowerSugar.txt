Ingredients:
[Dusting]
	2 tablespoons brown sugar
	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

[Topping]
	1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
	1/4 cup honey (or white sugar)
	1/4 cup brown sugar
	1 teaspoon baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
	1/6 cup hot/boiling water

[Filling]
	8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced into thin wedges
	2 tablespoons brown sugar
	1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
	1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
	2 teaspoons coconut flour (or cornstarch)

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
	Combine peaches, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2-quart baking dish.
	Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
	Meanwhile, combine flour, white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend in butter with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in water until just combined.
	Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of flour mixture over them.
	Mix together 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
