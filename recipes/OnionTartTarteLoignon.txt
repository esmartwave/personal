Ingredients:
	1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
	2 pounds yellow onions, sliced into rings
	2 springs fresh thyme
	2 eggs
	1/2 cup half and half
	5 strips bacon, diced
	2 tablespoons olive oil
	2 tablespoons butter
	1 teaspoon salt
	2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 375F. Melt the butter and oil together in a large skillet and add the diced bacon. Cook until the bacon is halfway cooked.
	Add the thyme, onion and salt to the skillet. Cook on medium-low heat until the onions are completely translucent and caramelized. This will take around 30 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
	Combine 2 eggs and the half and half in a bowl. Add the caramelized onion mixture and the freshly ground black pepper.
	Roll out the puff pastry in a buttered pie or glass dish. (Make sure the pastry has four edges in order to hold the onion mixture.)
	Add the mixture to the pastry and bake for 35 minutes or until the crust and top are slightly browned.
	Allow to cool, then slice and serve.

Notes: If there ever was a perfect dish for me, it would be onion tart. It's comforting, easy and inexpensive to prepare, filling and always better the next day. Onion tart is also my go-to dish for winter dinner parties, and this recipe that I learned in Normandy always ends up being a huge hit. The entire thing takes an hour from start to finish and your guests will be impressed. Think of onion tart like onion soup, but with a crust. Or quiche, but better. Life just got a little sweeter.
