Title: Kael and Carrot (Sorta) Waldorf Salad
Description: This salad is perfect for breakfast, as a stuffer for a chard wrap (or sandwich) for lunch, or even as dessert. It’s not a true “Waldorf” as it doesn’t contain any celery, but includes fennel bulb and kale and carrot instead. For me, it’s a fun way to ring in the fall, as it features a few of autumn’s most iconic flavors, yet is still light enough to enjoy during warmer temperatures.

Categories: kale, salad
Ingredients:
	1 1/2 cups finely chopped kale
	1 tablespoon lemon juice
	1 teaspoon sea salt
	1/2 cup grated fennel bulb
	7 medium carrots, grated
	1 apple, peel on, thinly sliced
	1/2 cup raisins (Thompson’s or Golden work well)
	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	2 teaspoons maple syrup (Grade B, recommended)
	1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked for a couple hours and drained
	2/3 cup water
	Dash Salt
	1 cup pecans, toasted

Instructions:
	Place the kale, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon sea salt into a bowl and massage gently with very clean hands until wilted. Toss in the fennel, carrots, apple, raisins, cinnamon and maple syrup and mix well to combine.
	In a food processor, blend the cashews with 2/3 cup water and a dash of salt for about 6 minutes, or until very smooth, scraping down sides as necessary. Stir the cashew cream into the salad to coat. Fold in pecans and top with a few fennel bulb greens for garnish.
	Serve cold or at room temperature. Amazing atop a bed of arugula.
	Note: To easily toast the pecans, bake in oven preheated to 375°F for 7 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool before eating.
