Ingredients:
	2 anchovy fillets
	2 cloves of crushed garlic, peeled
	1 teaspoon capers
	1 egg
	2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
	Salt
	Freshly ground black pepper
	1/4 cup olive oil
	1 pound freshly ground beef tenderloin
	1/4 cup minced shallots
	4 tablespoons chopped egg whites
	4 tablespoons chopped egg yolks
	4 tablespoons brunoise red onions
	4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
	8 slices of white bread, crust removed, tossed in olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper and toasted

Instructions:
	In a small wooden mixing bowl, combine the anchovy, capers and garlic. Using the back of a fork, crush the two and form a paste. Add the egg and mustard. Whisk well. Season with salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Whisk in the oil, to form an emulsion. In a cold mixing bowl, combine the tenderloin and shallots. Season with salt and pepper. Add the emulsion and mix well. Form the tartare into 4 ounce rounds, about 1-inch thick. Place in the center of four cold plates. Garnish each with traditional garnishes. Serve with toast points.
