Ingredients:
	1 tablespoon butter
	3 1/2 cups cubed peeled butternut squash (about 1 1/2 pounds)
	3/4 cup chopped carrot
	1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
	2 1/2 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
	1/4 cup half-and-half
	1/8 teaspoon salt

[Toasts]
	4 (1-ounce) slices French bread
	3 ounces thinly sliced Swiss cheese

Instructions:
	To prepare soup, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add squash, carrot, and onion; saut√© for 12 minutes. Add chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in half-and-half and salt.
	Preheat broiler.
	Place squash mixture in a blender. Remove center piece of blender lid (to allow steam to escape), and secure blender lid on blender. Place a clean towel over opening in blender lid (to avoid splatters). Blend until smooth.
	To prepare toasts, arrange French bread on a baking sheet. Broil for 1 minute or until lightly toasted. Turn bread over, and top evenly with Swiss cheese. Broil for 1 minute or until bubbly. Serve toasts with soup.
