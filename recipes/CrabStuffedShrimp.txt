Ingredients:
	3 lbs wild cuaght shrimp

[Shrimp Filling]
	1 lb crab meat (can be canned & pasteurized)
	2 cloves of smashed garlic
	fresh parsley
	1 teaspoon of Dijon
	Tabasco sauce
	celery finely diced, 2 small stalks
	onion or scallions finely diced 1/2 of a medium onion or a few scallions
	1 1/2 rolls of smashed crackers ( Ritz )
	melted butter, 3 0r 4 tablespoons
	lemon juice and lemon zest
	salt and pepper

[Sauce]
	1 1/2 cups of white champagne
	1 1/2 cups of cream
	2 or 3 shallots diced

Instructions:
[Shrimp & Filling]
	Make sure your shrimp is completely dry with no moisture, padding it with paper towel. Remove shell but leave the tails on. Along the inside of the curve take a sharp knife and cut along the length being careful not to cut all the way through. Take out any vein you see and then open like a book and press lightly to flatten.
	Sautee the diced celery and onions in 1 tablespoon of butter, then add in everything else, the mixture will hold together nicely and you will be able to mound it on top of your shrimp easily.
	Place stuffed shrimp on a parchment lined sheet pan and then spray or baste each one lightly with olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika. Bake at 375F for 15 or 20 minutes until pink and the stuffing is warmed through.
	After they’re baked set them in a shallow pool of champagne cream sauce and garnish with parsley and a lemon wedge.

[Sauce]
	Saute shallots in a dab of butter, pour in the champagne, let it reduce and then add cream and whisk until thickened.

Notes: For the filling my suggestion is to taste and add things as needed to your own personal liking, since the crab is already cooked you’ll have no problem doing that. Here’s what I added, you could use more or less.
