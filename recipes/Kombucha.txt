Ingredients:
	1/2 cup granulated sugar (plain-o)
	1 cup kombucha liquid
	1 SCOBY
	Extra purified water
	1/2 gallon mason jar
	2 cups purified water

Instructions:
	Fwd:Per half gallon. 2 cups filtered water Just under a boil. Take off heat and add 1 tablespoon of loose tea leaves four tea bags. Steep for 15 minutes.
	5 cup sugar white or evaporated cane juice into half gallon mason jar. Add tea and stir or shake to dissolve the sugar.
	Filtered cold water on hand. Fill with this water (about 4-4.5 cups) leaving room for cup kombucha and SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). Then add kombucha and SCOBY.
	If extra room then just add more cold filtered water. Add coffee filter as top with rubber band. Date on tape. Leave out and it like 70 degrees. On top of fridge.
	Start tasting it about five days.
	100% juice (1 part juice to 5 parts to star) or mashed up fruit (displaces 5th or 6th of water). Let sit for a couple days. Then put in fridge.
	Leave SCOBY in cup of kombucha tea. Tight lid. Store counter or fidge for couple of weeks.

Notes: Do not use any metal tools. Wood or plastic only. Make sure to inspect the SCOBY for any bright green or what might look like mold. Kombucha should be good for about 10 days after done brewing. You can also "second stage ferment" by adding some sugary fruit to the finished kombucha (once the SCOBY is removed). Blueberries make an awesome addition to green teas.

I use Rishi Kukicha and African Breakfast teas most commonly. Green and black work best, but no teas with essential oils.
