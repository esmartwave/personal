Ingredients:
	3 cloves garlic, minced
	1 tablespoon dried rosemary
	salt and pepper to taste
	2 pounds boneless pork loin roast
	1/4 cup olive oil
	1/2 cup white wine

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
	Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper, making a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press the garlic paste into the openings. Rub the meat with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil.
	Place pork loin into oven, turning and basting with pan liquids. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove roast to a platter. Heat the wine in the pan and stir to loosen browned bits of food on the bottom. Serve with pan juices.
