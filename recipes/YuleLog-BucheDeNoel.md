## Description
A traditional rolled sponge cake filled with cream and finished with chocolate icing. Designed for moist texture and clean rolling.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (60g) finely chopped hazelnuts, walnuts or pecans (optional)

## Instructions

### Sugard Toppings
If you want to decorate the cake with sugared cranberries and rosemary, start them the night before because they need to sit for several hours.
1. Place cranberries and rosemary in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside.
2. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, bring the water and 3/4 cup (150g) of sugar to a simmer, whisking until the sugar has dissolved. 
3. Remove the pan from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. 
4. Pour the sugar syrup over the cranberries and rosemary and stir. 
5. Cover the bowl and set aside for 15 minutes. - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. 
6. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cranberries and rosemary from the sugar syrup and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Allow to dry, uncovered, for 1 hour. 
7. Pour remaining 1/2 cup (100g) sugar into a large bowl. Toss the cranberries and rosemary in the sugar, coating them all the way around. 
8. Place on a parchment paper—or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and let them dry uncovered for at least 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator. 
9. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. 

### Making the cake
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. 
2. **this is key**: Cut out parchment paper to fit in the bottom of your cake pan, but not the sides (this makes it extremely easy to remove and roll). Grease parchment and pan.
3. **To start the frosting**: Place the chocolate in a bowl. Heat the cream in a saucepan until it begins to steam (don't let is scald). Pour over the chocolate, let sit for 2 to 3 minutes, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Set this ganache aside to cool to room temperature while you make the cake.
4. **To make the cake**: In a large bowl beat the eggs until thick and pale, then beat in the sugar, salt, and vanilla. Beat until the mixture is thick and the whisk leaves tracks in the bowl; this can take up to 3 minutes.
5. While the eggs are beating, sift together the flour, cocoa, cornstarch, espresso powder, and baking powder. When the egg mixture is ready, sift a third of the dry ingredients into the bowl and gently fold in; it’s OK if the batter is streaky at first. Repeat twice more until all the dry ingredients have been incorporated. 
6. Whisk together the oil and buttermilk and fold into the batter, mixing just until combined.
7. Pour the batter into the pan and lightly smooth the top with an offset spatula; it will be thin and might not quite reach the corners: that’s OK. Bake the cake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed. 
8. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 2 minutes. Loosen the edges with a knife. Plop cake onto a new piece of parchment paper or a tea towel (leaving the parchment used to bake still attached) or a silicon baking mat. Sprinke the new parchment paper or tea towel with a few tsp of cocoa powder. Gently and slowly roll the warm cake (starting on a shorter side) into a spiral shape; make it as tight of a spiral as you think you canwithout breaking the cake. Place it on a rack and let it cool completely, leaving it rolled as it cools. 
9. **To make the filling**: Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Mix in the vanilla. Stir together 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the Instant Clearjel (or gelatin) and beat into the cream; it will become thicker right away.
10. Stir the remaining tablespoon of sugar into the mascarpone and mix it into the whipped cream by hand (overwhipping mascarpone can make it grainy), using a whisk to fold in 1/4 cup of the mascarpone mixture at a time into the whipped cream.
11. **To finish the frosting**: Once the chocolate ganache has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to a mixing bowl and add the salt and vanilla. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the ganache on low speed and slowly add the butter in three additions. Once all the butter has been added, increase the speed and whip until fluffy, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

### Merengue Mushrooms
During this time, make the meringue mushrooms: 
1. Preheat oven to 200°F (93°C). 
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. In a completely clean residue-free large glass or metal mixing bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg white, cream of tartar, and salt together on high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes—this is a small amount and the whisk on a stand mixer might not reach it, so whisk by hand until foamy if needed. 
3. With the mixer running on high speed, slowly add the sugar and beat until stiff glossy peaks form, about 2 more minutes. 
4. Snip off the end of a plastic bag or fit a round piping tip in a piping bag. Pipe quarter-sized circles (these will be the round mushroom tops) and 1-inch tall cones (these will be the stems). You will have enough meringue batter for about 16 mushrooms, but stick with 8-12. 
5. Using a moistened finger (just a dab of water is fine), smooth down any peaks. If desired, lightly dust mushroom tops with cocoa powder using a fine mesh sieve. 
6. Bake for 2 hours. Do not open the oven as the meringues bake. Turn off the oven after 2 hours and let the meringues sit inside the cooling oven for 20 minutes. 
7. Remove meringues from the oven and cool completely. When they’re just about cool, melt the 1 ounce of chocolate in a double boiler or use the microwave. If using the microwave, melt in 15 second increments, stopping and stirring between each until melted and smooth. Cool for 5-10 minutes. (Easier to adhere mushrooms if the melted chocolate is a bit cool.) 
8. Once meringues have cooled, use a flat spatula to remove them from the baking sheets. Dot a bit of chocolate onto the center of the bottom of a mushroom top. Adhere a mushroom stem to it. Place back on the baking sheet to set. Let chocolate cool and harden, about 1 hour.

### Whipped Cream
1. Put everything bu the nusts together in a stand mixer bowl and whip it good until you get desired consistency.
2. apply to the dish as desired
3. sprinkle nuts as desired

## Notes
- Rolling while warm prevents cracking.
- Cake improves after chilling several hours
- If refridgerating or cooling, **make sure to cover the cake to preent drying out**
- Don't have mascarpone? Take one 8-ounce package (226g) of cream cheese or greek yogurt at room temperature and stir 1 tablespoon of sugar into it until it's smooth, with no lumps. Stir in 2 tablespoons (28g) of heavy cream, then use this mixture where the Yule Log Cake recipe calls for mascarpone.
